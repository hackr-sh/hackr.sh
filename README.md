This is my personal portfolio website. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). If you're interested in the way it's made, check out the source code!

## Get it running

There's no secrets here, so you should be able to get it up and running very fast if you have the right tools installed.

To keep things super simple, I've structutred most of my repositories recently in a way such that they're launchable using [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

If `mise-en-place` is installed:
- clone this repository
- cd into the repository
- run `mise trust`
- run `mise dev`

If you don't have `mise-en-place` installed, you can still get it up and running by running.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) @ v1.2

### Running

- clone this repository
- cd into the repository
- run `bun dev`

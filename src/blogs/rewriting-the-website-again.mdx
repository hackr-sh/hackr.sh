  Having a portfolio website is pretty important for a software engineer.
  It helps showcase your skills, and it's a great way to get noticed by potential employers. 
  It also teaches you a lot about deployment, hosting, CI/CD, and more, which are often seen 
  as crucial skills for someone looking into working as a Software Engineer (especially 
  those working on websites like yours truly).
  <br />
  As a software engineer, you typically have to constantly be learning new things. And this is
  where the website rewrites come in for me. The website rewrites come in typically once I've
  learned something new (such as a new framework, a new language, or a new tool), or when I've
  made a mistake in a framework or tool that was used to build the website, or when I've
  decided to learn something new on the promise of a framework or tool.

  <br />
  The reason I'm rewriting the website is because I've learned a lot over the past year, and I
  also wanted to give a shot at writing the website using Astro. I haven't touched Astro in
  any professional capacity before, and I'm still learning the ropes but with the Astro 5.0
  release, it's got a lot of potential packed into it that would be great to explore.
  <br />
  So, yeah, this is basically a "I'm learning something new" website. I've been making websites
  for a long time, (I started building them back in 2013 for my robotics team), and I've learned
  and grown so much since I first started.
  <br />

  <br />
  The very first website I made was a simple website built using HTML and CSS (there was javascript
  too, but I had no idea how to use it so it consisted of a ton of copy-pasted code). It was a hodgepodge
  of various paralax scrolling effects, highly-unoptimized images, and absolutely atrocious coding practices.
  <br />
  It was deployed using cPanel, and it was an absolute pain to maintain. By the end of the lifetime of
  the website, I was basically a professional at SFTPing files around and manually updating the website
  (all without git - imagine that!). There was no CI/CD, no versioning, and no automatic deployments. We can
  forget about having a database at all too.
  <br />
  Whenever it needed to be updated, I would have to manually update the website (and seeing as I didn't know
  javascript that well, each update would take <i>forever</i>). The amount of friction involved almost completely
  detracted me from ever pursuing a career in any form of software engineering.

  <br />
  Following that trainwreck of a website, I pivoted and decided to use a framework that allowed me to
  reference blocks of code so that they could automatically be added to a given page. I chose to use
  EJS (Embedded Javascript) for the templating engine and I learned a lot. With that iteration, I was
  back to being hooked on software engineering. EJS allowed me to write clean, maintainable code that
  was easy to read and understand. I still didn't have a good grasp on javascript or CI/CD, or had a
  better development experience than I had before, but it was a start.
  <br />
  I then decided to rewrite the website again, but this time using React. I learned about React during
  a hackathon and it seemed easy enough to use at the time (If only I knew how deep the React rabbit hole
  went). I was hooked on React and I was excited to see what it could do. This is where a lot of my growth
  in the field of website development (and software engineering in general) started. I started using
  databases, I got better writing CSS, started using git, was able to setup a rather crude CI/CD pipeline,
  and learned about testing frameworks like Jest. I also started learning about server-side rendering (SSR)
  and how it could be used to improve the performance of my website. This is where I started to see the
  power of React and how it could be used to build complex web applications.
  <br />
  My most recent rewrite (excluding this one) was last year. The design of the website was completely 
  overhauled (it looks the same as the current version), and it was built using Next.js (primarily 
  because of the amazing Image optimizations and the fact that I was deploying to Vercel anyways). 
  We had a database, proper CI/CD, clean code with good coding practices in general. We were using
  Tailwind CSS for styling - it was a beautiful experience to work with. So - why the rewrite?
  <br />

  <br />
  Well because although setting up a website with authentication, database (connected via the Prisma ORM),
  and tRPC was a lot of fun, it wasn't sustainable. People could feel a certain lagginess on various pages since
  data retrieval wasn't instantaneous and it also used too many resources for what it was - a portfolio website.
  <br />
  I'm not saying that the rewrite was a bad experience, but it wasn't sustainable.
  <br />
  This "final" rewrite was chosen because of the promises of Astro. Having islands of code that can be from
  any major framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) was a huge plus. I was able to use the Astro 5.0 release
  to build a website that was much more maintainable and performant than the previous website. This blogpost, 
  for example, is simply an MDX file that is converted to HTML using Astro.
  <br />
  I also got to keep a ton of my old components and hooks that only worked in React/Next.js. I was able to
  use them in Astro and they worked perfectly. I also got to keep my old styles and images, the routing system
  hasn't changed much, and I no longer had to worry about the database since I can manually specify collections
  and a given collection's properties.
  <br />
  This likely won't be the last rewrite, so I'm excited to see what the future holds. I've had a blast working
  with Astro, and the more likely scenario is that there probably won't be a massive overhaul but as of writing
  this, tailwind v4.0 just released and I'm sure it'll be a good reason to rewrite the website again. As the world
  of software engineering continues to evolve, better tools and frameworks will be developed that will prompt more
  and more changes and so, the personal portfolio is never truly "done", but I do feel like it's a good place to be
  for now.
